Hilly
======

Adapted from adamfranco/curvature by Glen Rubin to focus on steep roads instead of twisty ones, with North Carolina as a test region.

Find roads that are the most sloped or hilly based on Open Street Map (OSM) data, with elevation from SRTM.

The goal of this program is to help those who enjoy twisty roads (such as
motorcycle or driving enthusiasts) to find promising roads that are not well known.
It works by calculating a synthetic "curvature" parameter for each road segment
(known as a "way" in OSM parlance) that represents how twisty that segment is.
These twisty segments can then be output as KML files that can be viewed in Google Earth
or viewed in tabular form.

About the "curvature" parameter:
--------------------------------
The "curvature" of a way is determined by iterating over every set of three points
in the line. Each set of three points form a triangle and that triangle has a circumcircle
whose radius corresponds to the radius of the curve for that set. Since every line
segment (between two points) is part of two separate triangles, the radius of the curve
at that segment is considered to be the smaller, larger, or average of the radii for its member sets.
Now that we have a curve radius for each segment we can categorize each segment into
ranges of radii from very tight (short radius turn) to very broad or straight (long radius turn).
Once each segment is categorized its length can be multiplied by a weight to increase the
influence of the most curvy segments. By default a weight of 0 is given for straight segments,
1 for broad curves, and up to 2 for the tightest curves. The sum of all of the weighted
lengths gives us a number for the curvature of the whole line that corresponds proportionally
to the distance (in meters) that you will be in a turn.*

\* If all weights are 1 then the curvature parameter will be exactly the distance in turns.
The goal of this project however is to prefer tighter turns, so sharp corners are given an
increased weight.

  [vermont-latest.osm.pbf](http://download.geofabrik.de/north-america/us/vermont-latest.osm.pbf)
  file (above).

  This file includes all ways in the input file that have a curvature value greater than 300
  and are not marked as unpaved. As mentioned above, a curvature of 300 this means that these
  ways have at least 150 meters of tight curves with a radius of less than 30 meters, 300 meters
  of gentle curves with a radius less than 175 meters, or a combination thereof.

  In practice, a curvature of 300 is useful for finding roads that might be a bit fun
  in a sea of otherwise bland options. While more curvy roads will also be included, roads
  in the 300-600 range tend to be pleasant rather than exciting.

  An additional note: Vermont has approximately [8,000 miles of dirt roads and only 6,000 miles
of paved roads](http://www.nytimes.com/1996/06/24/us/in-slow-paced-vermont-the-dirt-road-reigns.html).
  At the time of this writing most of the dirt roads were not tagged as such in Open Street
  Map, leading to the inclusion of many dirt roads in the KML file above. I have tagged
  many of the roads in my region with appropriate 'surface' tags, but there is more to be done.
  Head to [openstreetmap.org](http://www.openstreetmap.org/) and help tag roads with appropriate
  surfaces so that we can better filter our results.

* A basic KML file generated with a minimum curvature of 1000 using the pre-processed
  [vermont-latest.osm.pbf](http://download.geofabrik.de/north-america/us/vermont-latest.osm.pbf)
  file (above).

  This file includes all ways in the input file that have a curvature value greater than 1000
  and are not marked as unpaved. As mentioned above, a curvature of 1000 this means that these
  ways have at least 500 meters of tight curves with a radius of less than 30 meters, 1000 meters
  of gentle curves with a radius less than 175 meters, or a combination thereof.

  In practice a minimum curvature of 1000 is useful for finding the best roads in a region.
  There will be many roads that are quite fun but don't quite make the cut, but all of the
  roads listed will be very curvy.

  This file colors the ways listed in the second example based on curve radius.
  Zoom on corners to see the shading. Green segments do not contribute to the 'curvature' value

Installation
============

Prerequisites
-------------

*Python*
This is a Python script, therefore you need a functional Python 3 or later environment on your computer.
This program has been tested on Python 3.5.
See http://python.org/

*Boost.Python*
Boost is system for providing C++ libraries (like libosmium) to Python

*libosmium*
http://osmcode.org/libosmium/manual.html#building-libosmium

The `sparsehash` package will also be needed for the following to work.

    wget https://github.com/osmcode/libosmium/archive/v2.10.2.tar.gz
    tar xzf v2.10.2.tar.gz
    cd  libosmium-2.10.2/
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake -g INSTALL_PROTOZERO ../
    make && make install


*pyosmium*
After libosmium is available on your system, you should be able to use `pip` to
install the python osmium bindings.

    pip install osmium

Issues: On my system (OS X 10.10.5 with most packages installed via MacPorts) I
had to take two additional steps to fix errors in building osmium with `pip`.

1. MacPorts put the boost.python installation in `/opt/local/include/boost/` while
   osmium is looking for it in `/opt/local/lib/boost/`. Making a symbolic link
   solved this.

        cd /opt/local/lib
        ln -s ../include/boost boost

2. I was seeing the following error:

        In file included from lib/osmium.cc:5:
        In file included from /usr/local/include/osmium/area/assembler.hpp:62:
        /usr/local/include/osmium/tags/filter.hpp:41:10: fatal error: 'boost/iterator/filter_iterator.hpp' file not found
        #include <boost/iterator/filter_iterator.hpp>

I fixed this by ensuring that a `BOOST_PREFIX` variable was in my shell environment
before running `pip`:

        export BOOST_PREFIX=/opt/local/
        pip install osmium

*msgpack*
curvature makes use of `msgpack` which you can find at
[python.org](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/msgpack-python) and installed
with `pip` or `easy_install`:

    pip install msgpack-python

Optional dependencies
---------------------
*psycopg2*
Needed if you want to load Curvature output into a PostGIS database.

Curvature Installation
----------------------
Once your Python environment set up and the `imposm.parser` and `msgpack-python` modules are installed, just download
Curvature and run one of the provided processing chains:

    git clone https://github.com/adamfranco/curvature.git
    cd curvature
    ./processing_chains/adams_default.sh -h

Running tests
-------------
You can run the unit tests for curvature by running the following from the project directory:

    py.test

Usage
=====
Curvature works with Open Street Map (OSM) XML data files. While you can export these from a
small area directly from [openstreetmap.org](http://www.openstreetmap.org/) , you are limited to a
small area with a limited number of points so that you don't overwhelm the OSM system. A better
alternative is to download daily exports of OSM data for your region from
[Planet.osm](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Planet.osm).

This script was developed using downloads of the US state OSM data provided at:
[download.geofabrik.de/openstreetmap](http://download.geofabrik.de/openstreetmap/north-america/us/)

Once you have downloaded a .osm or .osm.pbf file that you wish to work with, you can run one of the the predefined processing changes with their default options:

    ./processing_chains/adams_defaults.sh -v vermont.osm.pbf

This will generate a set of compressed KMZ files that includes lines for all of the matched segments.

Use

    ./processing_chains/adams_defaults.sh -h

for more options.

Basic KML Output
----------
Open the KML files in Google Earth. GoogleEarth can become overloaded with giant KML files, so the
default mode is to generate a single placemark for each matching way that has a single-color
line-string. On a reasonably modern computer even large files such as roads with curvature greater
than 300 in California can be rendered when formatted in this way.

Colored-curves KML Output
--------------------
Additionally, this script allows rendering of ways as a sequence of segments color-coded based on
the curvature of each segment. These 'colorized' KML files provide a neat look at the radius of turns and are especially useful when tuning the radii and weights for each level to adjust which ways are matched. The color-coding is as follows: straight segments are green and the four levels of curves are color-coded from yellow to red with decreasing turn radii.

Unfortunately, these multi-colored ways are significantly more difficult for GoogleEarth to render
than the longer single-color segments, so try to avoid files larger than about 40MB. Google Earth
can easily handle smaller areas like Vermont with a curvature of 300, but larger regions (like
California) may need to be trimmed down with a bounding box if you wish to make usable multicolor
KML files.

Building your own processing scripts
====================================
The processing-chains in `curvature/processing_chains/` are just a few examples of ways to use this
program. You can easily pipe output from one filter to the next to modify the data stream to your liking.

The easiest way to create your own processing chain is to copy `adams_default.sh` and edit the
sequence of steps to filter more or fewer road segments.

Collecting
----------
Usually, any processing-chain will start with a call to the `bin/curvature-collect` script to take
the input `.osm.pbf` data and convert it to a stream of *collections*. Each *collection* is an
ordered sequence of one or more Open Street Map *ways*. Where possible, *ways* are joined end to end
into long sequences that all share the same `name` tag or `ref` tag (used for routes, like `US 7`).
This collecting process gives us the most complete linear "roads" it is possible to extract from the
data and allows us to look at a long shape of a road as a unit even if it is broken up into many
different ways to account for changing speed-limit tags, bridge tags, etc.

The input of the collecting process is an osm-xml file or an `.osm.pbf` file. The output is
a MessagePack stream written to STDOUT, which can then either be piped to another script or
written to a file.

Example, writing to a file:

    bin/curvature-collect -v ~/Downloads/vermont.osm.pbf > vermont.msgpack

Example, piping to other scripts:

    bin/curvature-collect -v ~/Downloads/vermont.osm.pbf | bin/msgpack-reader

Note the binary MessagePack format is very fast to read/write, but it is not particularly
space-efficient. When writing to disk (instead of piping between scripts) it may
be faster (and is definitely more space-efficient) to pipe the MessagePack data through
GZIP:

    bin/curvature-collect -v ~/Downloads/vermont.osm.pbf | gzip > vermont.msgpack.gz

    cat vermont.msgpack.gz | gunzip | bin/msgpack-reader | head -n 50

Reading the MessagePack stream
------------------------------
When developing processing-chains, it is sometimes helpful to get a human-readable
view of the output at each stage. The `bin/msgpack-reader` program takes a MessagePack
stream on STDIN and writes a human-readable version of the data on STDOUT. Example:

    bin/curvature-collect -v ~/Downloads/vermont.osm.pbf | bin/msgpack-reader | head -n 50

    'ways': [   {   'coords': [   [43.6371221, -72.33376860000001],

                                'tiger:county': 'Windsor, VT'}}]}

The `head` *post processor* is also helpful for viewing output as it will truncate
the output to just the first *n* collections (whereas the POSIX `head` command
works on number of lines).

Example:

    bin/curvature-collect -v ~/Downloads/vermont.osm.pbf | bin/curvature-pp head -n 2 | bin/msgpack-reader

Calculating
-----------
The filter, splitting, sorting, and modifying operations are handled by a set of *post processors*
found at `curvature/cuvature/post_processors/`. *Post processors* are called by piping the
MessagePack stream to the `bin/curvature-pp` program with the post-processor desired as
the first argument.

The `add_segments`, `add_segment_length_and_radius`, `add_segment_curvature`, and
`filter_segment_deflections` *post processors* are generally used together to
analyze the geometry of each *way*.

1. `add_segments` converts the sequence of coordinates that make up a *way* into
   pairs of coordinates that make up a line-segment. This new *segment* object in
   the data stream can then have additional calculations performed on it.

2. `add_segment_length_and_radius` calculates the length of the segment as well as the
   curve-radius for that segment.

3. `add_segment_curvature` multiplies a radius-classified weight by the segment-length
   to give us the *cuvature* value for the segment.

4. `filter_segment_deflections` looks for jiggles in otherwise straight ways and filters
   out the curvature value for these segments to prevent noisy data from being interpreted
   the same as hairpin curves.

Other calculating *post-processors* are `roll_up_length`, `roll_up_curvature`, and
`remove_way_properties`.

Filtering and splitting
-----------------------
The `filter_xxxx_ways_xxxx`, `filter_collections_by_xxxx` and `split_collections_on_xxxx`
*post processors* allow you to remove collections (or portions of collections) that
don't meet your criteria.

For example, you may only want to include roads that are paved, so you might use the
`filter_out_ways_with_tag` *post processor* to remove ways that have `surface` tags that
indicate an unpaved road-surface.

    cat vermont.msgpack | bin/curvature-pp filter_out_ways_with_tag --tag surface --values 'unpaved,dirt,gravel,fine_gravel,sand,grass,ground,pebblestone,mud,clay,dirt/sand,soil' | bin/msgpack-reader

You can also filter on complex boolean expressions using the `filter_out_ways` *post processor*, such
as all of the driveways in the US that were incorrectly imported as unnamed 'residential' ways:

    cat vermont.msgpack | bin/curvature-pp filter_out_ways --match 'And(TagEmpty("name"), TagEmpty("ref"), TagEquals("highway", "residential"), TagEquals("tiger:reviewed", "no"))' | bin/msgpack-reader

The `filter_xxxx_ways_xxxx` and `split_collections_on_xxxx` *post processors* will break
apart collections into multiple resulting collections, so if you ran the above example
on an input file that had a road that started paved, became gravel, then became paved again,
the output would have 2 *collections* (one for each paved portion) and the gravel portion would be dropped.

The `filter_collections_by_xxxx` *post processors* simply drop entire collections without
modifying them. For example, you could exclude road-sections shorter than 1 mile (1609 meters) with:

    cat vermont.msgpack | bin/curvature-pp filter_collections_by_length --min 1609 | bin/msgpack-reader

Output
------
After you have massaged the data to your liking, you can then pipe the MessagePack stream
to one of the output programs like `bin/curvature-output-kml` or `bin/curvature-output-tab`
to write a data-file. Example:

    cat vermont.msgpack | curvature-output-kml > doc.kml

GeoJSON Output
--------------
Use the `curvature-output-geojson` script to export results as a GeoJSON file that
can be used in many GIS programs.

    cat vermont.msgpack | curvature-output-geojson > veromnt.geojson

PostGIS Output
--------------
In addition to writing KML and text files, Curvature can also insert each segment
into a PostGIS database.

You will need a PostGIS database server and account credentials to access it.
The database schema expected can be found in [output-master/curvature.sql](output-master/curvature.sql).
Once your database is set up and the schema created you can insert batches of curvature
data using the `curvature-output-postgis` output. For example:

    cat vermont.msgpack | bin/curvature-output-postgis -v \
      --source north_america/us/vermont --clear \
      --database curvature --user curvatureuser --password curvaturepassword

The `--source` option provides a shared key for this working data set to allow you
to build up and refresh a world-wide database one region at a time. The `--clear`
option tells the output to clear existing values associated with the source before
inserting the new ones. `--host` and `--port` options are also available.

* Postgres output now only stores highway, surface, smoothness, and maxspeed at
  the way-level rather than summed at the segment level. This dramatically
  reduces the number of tags stored in the database. Way-level details can also
  be more easily summed with statistics client-side.
* In addition to `ref`, way-joining now will use `official_ref`, `admin_ref`,
  `highway_ref`, or `highway_authority_ref` as the joining key.
  This fixes #65. Thanks to Pink Duck for reporting this issue affecting UK
  county roads.

**Upgrade note:** This release requires updating the PostGIS database structure
to remove the fk_highway, fk_surface, fk_maxspeed, and fk_smoothness columns
and their associated constraints from the curvature_segments table.
See `output-master/curvature.sql` for the new schema.

2.4.0 - 2021-03-17
------------------
* Add support for storing maxspeed tags in postgres output.
* Add support for storing smoothness tags in postgres output.

**Upgrade note:** This release requires updating the PostGIS database structure to support new fk_maxspeed and fk_smoothness columns.

2.3.0 - 2020-12-02
------------------
* PostGIS output can now record the extent affected by updates.
* Now squashing curvature values for ways with certain tags (e.g. junction roundabout), near changes in oneway tags (to avoid "chained" modeling of roads from registering as curvy), and near nodes with certain tags (e.g. crossings, stop/yield signs, traffic signals, traffic-calming, etc)

2.2.1 - 2020-10-08
------------------
* Many fixes to get tests working again. (Thanks, Daryl Matuszak)
* updates args to unpacker to comply with msgpack 1.0
* Use '{}'.format(x) instead of f'{x}' for compat. with Python 3.5 & 3.6.

Release contributors: Adam Franco, Daryl Matuszak

2.2.0 - 2017-02-06
------------------
* Add PostGIS output
* Fix string replace syntax in Python 3.5.
* Fix edge case where highway & surface tags contain non-ascii characters.
* Add post processors to setup.py
* Fix type error in Python 3.5. Wouldn't allow comparing `None > 0`.
* Update the tab-delimited output to work again after much neglect.
* Refactored AddSegmentLengthAndRadius to make the code more readable.
* Skip nodes with invalid location rather than failing.

2.1.0 - 2016-12-07
------------------
Updated from Python 2.7 to Python 3.5. Also removed the dependency on the Python27-only
imposom.parser library in favor of the well-maintained Osmium PBF parsing library.
Python 2.7 is no longer supported by Curvature.

2.0.0 - 2016-11-04
------------------
Curvature 2 is a complete rewrite of the program with a new stream-based processing model.
Curvature 1 was a single large Python program with many, many options. To add flexibility,
Curvature 2 is a collection of very small programs that each can modify the data-stream
in a limited way. These small programs can then be linked together in complex *processing chains*
that can be easily customized or reordered for performance or to achieve different results.

The piped MessagePack streams are the recommended way to build processing chains using this
release of Curvature. Additional pure-Python processing-chains are included as experimental
examples, however the API for configuring these may change in future releases.

For end-users, Curvature 2 now has improved KML output that distinguishes between
primary/secondary/motorway/known-paved roads and roads whose surface is unknown.
Tertiary/residential/unclassified roads without a `surface` tag will now render as
thinner and less opaque. These might be excellent roads, but if you like to stick to
asphalt, you might need to do some additional checking for these roads.
